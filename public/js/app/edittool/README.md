This version of shapeshift was modified to fit the traffic planning tool which is subject of my bachelor thesis.

based on Shapeshift v2.0 published on April 16th, 2013

modifications:
- option editTool
	- single line widget orientation (always, if editTool is enabled)
    - resizable widgets (by default)
	- container can be 'full' if width is fixed (by default)
